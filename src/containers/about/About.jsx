    <p>Hi I'm Shaheed. I'm a 19-year-old kid who does multiple things and is passionate about Music Production, DJ, Visual Effects, 3D Animations, Photo Manipulation, and more.</p>
    <p>I've been doing this for three years and still learning more skills regarding what I know. Born in Adirampattinam, Tamil Nadu, India, and currently living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. During my high school days, I've been helping to make little short videos for my friends. That's what got me into what I'm doing currently it inspires me to learn multiple skills.</p>
